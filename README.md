# K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier for Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains an implementation of a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier to predict the sentiment of 25,000 movie reviews provided in a test file.

## Dataset

The project utilizes two datasets:

1. **Training Dataset**: Consists of 25,000 movie reviews along with their corresponding sentiments, labeled as +1 (positive) and -1 (negative).
2. **Test Dataset**: Contains 25,000 movie reviews for which sentiment predictions are to be made.
